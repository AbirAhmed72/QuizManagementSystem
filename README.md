Project for Software Project Lab-1

Project Description :
There will be login and signup system for both teacher panel and student panel.
Question bank can be contributed by the teacher panel from where the questions will be
taken from. Questions will be of 3 different difficulties which are :
● Easy (Carries 1 mark)
● Medium (Carries 3 marks)
● Hard (Carries 5 marks)
The teacher can also input percentages of each difficulties and the software will pickup the
questions from the question bank accordingly. Such as, 50% easy + 30% medium + 20%
hard will result in 5 easy questions, 3 medium questions and 2 hard questions.
To prevent cheating, questions appearing to each students will be in random order and the
options to the questions will also be randomized.
Each question will have a specific timer and if a student fails to answer within that time,
the question will disappear and the student will lose marks.
There will be another mode named "Smart Mode" where the question paper will start with
Easy difficulty questions and the difficulty will gradually increase/decrease based on how
the student performs to answer. It will be a good scale to measure the students' aptitude.
Finally, the students will be able to see if their answers are correct or not and also the
correct answer when they fail to attempt correctly or in time.
